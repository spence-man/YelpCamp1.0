## Synopsis

Yelp Camp is a full-stack JS web application using NodeJs, MongoDB, NPM and Express. Visitors can sign up and post interesting campsites with information, comments and pricing.   This was a project created from the Web Developer Bootcamp course to demonstrate building a production application. It contains REStful Routing with authentication (Passport.js), and authorization. A package.json file is included for the additional packages used. 


## Code Example

This source code contains the complete package to run YelpCamp locally. See Installation for the full requirements.

## Motivation

This was a final project created from the Udemy course, The Web Developer Bootcamp. This project taught me the groundworks of Node.Js, Express, MongoDB, HTTP requests, authorization and authentication.

## Installation

This project used Node.js and NPM to build a fast network application. I used Homebrew, a package manager for the Mac, to facilitate the installation method. The prequisities are: XCode (Apple’s XCode development software) and Homebrew. 
"Homebrew handles downloading, unpacking and installing Node and NPM on your system. The whole process (after you have XCode and Homebrew installed) should only take you a few minutes." - Team Treehouse Blog.

Open the Terminal app and type brew install node.
Sit back and wait. Homebrew downloads some files and installs them. And that’s it.
To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, run two simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

To see if Node is installed, type node -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.31.
To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.27

Main App Setup
1. Configure your own MongoDB database in the app.js file.
2. To run the app: Go to the terminal and type node app.js
